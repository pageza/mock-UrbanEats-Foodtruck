# Urban Eats Food Truck Website

## Project Overview
The Urban Eats Food Truck website is a dynamic and responsive web application designed to showcase the vibrant and diverse offerings of a modern fusion street food truck. This project is built with a Go backend to provide a robust and efficient server-side experience, and the front-end technology will be chosen later to ensure a rich user experience with a focus on mobile responsiveness and real-time features.

### Key Features:
- **Vibrant Design**: A visually appealing, image-heavy layout that showcases the food truck's diverse menu. The front-end technology to be used will be chosen to best leverage dynamic rendering capabilities.
- **Real-Time Location Tracker**: An integrated mapping feature that provides customers with the real-time location of the food truck. This feature is powered by the Go backend for efficient real-time updates.
- **Dynamic Menu**: An easily updatable menu interface, allowing the food truck owner to quickly modify menu items, prices, and descriptions. The interactive and dynamic front-end for this feature will be developed to ensure seamless interaction.
- **Social Media Integration**: Live feeds from social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter, bringing customer engagement directly onto the site.
- **Responsive and Mobile-Friendly**: The design will be mobile-first, ensuring accessibility and an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

### Technologies Used:
- **Back-End**: Go for a high-performance and scalable server-side application.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing and retrieving data, including real-time location and menu information.
- **Front-End**: The technology for the front-end will be selected later to complement the Go backend and provide a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Real-Time Communication**: The backend will include real-time communication capabilities for features like location tracking.
- **Additional Tools**: Integration with mapping services for the location tracker and social media APIs for live feeds.
